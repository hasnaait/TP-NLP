It is important to understand just how significant this new idea was. It was a revolutionary move away from the Greek concept of mathematics which was essentially geometry. Algebra was a unifying theory which allowedrational numbers,irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as \\\"algebraic objects\\\". It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject. Another important aspect of the introduction of algebraic ideas was that it allowed mathematics to be applied to itselfin a way which had not happened before.\"\"\""
